                            In a world where healthcare and health insurance is a primary concern for citizens and
                            policymakers, we saw a need to create an equal opportunity for one of the most important and
                            relatively expensive tests worldwide. Testing for genetic disorders, although taken for granted in
                            some countries, is a major gap in others. Whether it is the lack of awareness, equipment,
                            expertise or simply the overpriced exams, the Middle East and many less fortunate countries
                            suffer from the spread of genetic disease. We found no better way to describe our motives than
                            by collectively extrapolating our drives to take part in this research. We believe that combining
                            our different cultural backgrounds, skills, and knowledge to realistically and passionately make
                            the slightest enhancement to the lives of those who we feel compassionate about and to
                            contribute to the scientific community is our sincere purpose. Furthermore, our trust in the
                            essentiality of the technique we are introducing allowed to participate again with a developed
                            vision of our last iGEM idea with no setbacks.

                            Inspired by Dr. Doudna’s published work “CRISPR- Cas12a target binding unleashes
                            indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity”, we are utilizing CRISPR for purposes other than
                            gene editing to create a novel, field-ready, diagnostic technique for carriers of recessive traits.
                            Cas12a proteins are DNA targeting enzymes that recognize DNA based on a guide RNA
                            (gRNA) sequence designed to match a target. The binding initiates non-specific single-stranded
                            DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity in Cas12a sufficient to degrade linear and circular ssDNA within
                            minutes. Through this, ssDNA attached to fluorescent dye and quencher, serving as reporters,
                            will undergo degradation. Upon cleavage, the quencher is released and fluorescence is emitted.
                            This mechanism will be used where a complementary gRNA of a specific recessive genetic
                            disease will be integrated into the Cas12a protein such when the target DNA is processed by
                            Cas12a and bound to the gRNA, cleavage activity proceeds to eventually emit fluorescence.
                            Afterward, using a device we built and programmed, the fluorescence will be detected with
                            high-sensitivity and algorithmic analysis of the measurement will determine a +/- result for the
                            disease.

                                iGEM 2018 round, this year we are integrating the judges and other experts feedback to
                                optimize the sensitivity of our device, broaden our technique to identify other similar genetic
                                diseases and to provide a pre-counseling prediction calculation. Our endeavor will be
                                achievable by measuring the fluorescence emitted in the processing of a template DNA by
                                Cas12a in comparison with double-blinded DNA samples. Moreover, we are designing gRNAs
