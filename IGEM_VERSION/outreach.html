                        <span>Our community outreach event for 9th graders was carried out at Compass International School. Members of our outreach team along with our advisor, introduced the basics of genetics and genetic diseases to eager fourteen year olds. With our project focussing on tackling the prevalence of genetic diseases in Qatar, the aim of the event was to teach students exactly how these diseases arise. In order to do this we took on two strategies; an interactive lecture and a practical session using C. Elegans worm models. The lecture focussed on introducing the idea of recessive and dominant diseases, the genetic basis of them and introducing pedigrees to illustrate how genes can travel through generations. The practical session depicted mutated C. Elegans with various genetic diseases to illustrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. This outreach event also briefly introduced the science behind our project and highlighted how it hopes to tackle the problem at hand.</span>

                            <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">The outreach team reached out to high school students in their final year of school in order to get feedback on the design and application of our team’s iGEM project. The students were first introduced to our project; we especially focussed on the problem of recessive diseases in Qatar. In addition to how genetic diseases arise, we introduced them to the details of our project and how the mechanics of the device works from a biological standpoint. We then opened the floor for discussion on the social and ethical impact of our group’s work. This was run in small focus groups of six to seven students. A scribe and discussion facilitator guided the discussion by asking scenario based questions that demanded ethical thought from the students. Overall, the outreach event succeeded in gaining perspective on society’s views on the device and the potential problems it might face in the market.</p>
