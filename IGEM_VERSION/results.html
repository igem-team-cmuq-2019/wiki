To test for off-target binding, we mixed Cystic fibrosis WT DNA template and the gRNA corresponding to the Cystic Fibrosis G mutation in lane 5, and as expected there was no fragmentation observed which highlights the accuracy of the detection of the s75389940_G SNP </span>

Then, in samples 2 and 4, the peak shown in the control samples is fragmented to several peaks (circled)  to reflect fragmentation due to Cas12a activity. In Sample 5  where WT_CF template is paired with a wrong guide (gRNA_rs75389940_G), the peak remained intact as expected.</span>

On the other hands, lanes 4 and 5 showed no fragmentation as there was no gRNA added to help the Cas12a bind to the DNA template and become active. The off-target binding was proven to be almost null again as there is no fragmentation observed, hence confirming that a mismatch of gRNA and DNA template does not cause binding, and hence false results.</span>

Lanes 1 and 2  display that Cas12a was successfully activated due to the presence of the corresponding gRNA . On the other hand the control samples 4 and 5 had an intact peak reflecting no fragmentation and thus no Cas12a activity.
