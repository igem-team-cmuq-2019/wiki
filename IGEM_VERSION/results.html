Moreover, this shows that optimized gRNA for the rs334_C mutation and the HBB_WT is effective as it gets used by Cas12a to target the gene of interest. In addition, in the control samples, lanes 4,5,6, no fragmentation was observed confirming that the lack of gRNA prevents the activation of the indiscriminate cleavage activity of Cas12a since there will be no binding. Nevertheless, while fragmentation was expected in lane 1 due to the Cas12a targeting the s334_T mutation in the HBB gene, none was observed. Experimental techniques and PAM sequence editing were taken in consideration and altered </span>

The control samples lacking the gRNA showed no fragmentation in lanes 1,3,and 5 indicating no Cas12a activity due to its inability to bind. As for lane 4 where fragmentation was expected, nothing appeared. From the replicate we confirmed that there seems to be a low affinity binding between the Cas12a and the rs334_T gRNA due to the PAM site specificity. </span>
