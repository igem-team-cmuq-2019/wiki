                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">In a world where healthcare and health insurance is a primary concern for citizens and policymakers, we saw a need to create an equal opportunity for one of the most important and relatively expensive tests worldwide. Testing for genetic disorders, although taken for granted in some countries, is a major gap in others. Whether it is the lack of awareness, equipment, expertise or simply the overpriced exams, the Middle East and many less fortunate countries suffer from the spread of genetic disease. We found no better way to describe our motives than by collectively extrapolating our drives to take part in this research. We believe that combining our different cultural backgrounds, skills, and knowledge to realistically and passionately make the slightest enhancement to the lives of those who we feel compassionate about and to contribute to the scientific community is our sincere purpose. Furthermore, our trust in the essentiality of the technique we are introducing allowed to participate again with a developed vision of our last iGEM idea with no setbacks.</p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Inspired by Dr. Doudna’s published work “CRISPR- Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity”, we are utilizing CRISPR for purposes other than gene editing to create a novel, field-ready, diagnostic technique for carriers of recessive traits. Cas12a proteins are DNA targeting enzymes that recognize DNA based on a guide RNA (gRNA) sequence designed to match a target. The binding initiates non-specific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity in Cas12a sufficient to degrade linear and circular ssDNA within minutes. Through this, ssDNA attached to fluorescent dye and quencher, serving as reporters, will undergo degradation. Upon cleavage, the quencher is released and fluorescence is emitted. This mechanism will be used where a complementary gRNA of a specific recessive genetic disease will be integrated into the Cas12a protein such when the target DNA is processed by Cas12a and bound to the gRNA, cleavage activity proceeds to eventually emit fluorescence. Afterward, using a device we built and programmed, the fluorescence will be detected with high-sensitivity and algorithmic analysis of the measurement will determine a +/- result for the disease.</p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Although the bases of our research project have been presented by our team in the iGEM 2018 round, this year we are integrating the judges and other experts feedback to optimize the sensitivity of our device, broaden our technique to identify other similar genetic diseases and to provide a pre-counseling prediction calculation. Our endeavor will be achievable by measuring the fluorescence emitted in the processing of a template DNA by Cas12a in comparison with double-blinded DNA samples. Moreover, we are designing gRNAs for locally and internationally common genetic diseases, other than the Sickle cell anemia one which we worked on earlier, including Cystic Fibrosis, and Gaucher disease. As for our technical part of the team, the software and hardware team are working on integrating Bayesian Statistical analysis of genetic diseases into a software connected to the hand-held device created earlier and a lab-desktop device.</p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">At last, the combination of the biological technique along with the programmed software and built devices will provide an on-field and in-lab genetic testing method that overcomes the limitations of sequencing, it being a cost-ineffective and labor-intensive. It will also eliminate the biohazard use of blood where DNA will be efficiently extracted from saliva samples making our technique less invasive. Finally, our project introduces an eye-opening perspective of the broader uses of CRISPR in the field of synthetic biology and raises the challenge of beneficially and ethically exploiting these uses.</p>
