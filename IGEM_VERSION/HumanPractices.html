                        <span>In order to better understand and simulate the process of genetic counseling, we interviewed Fatima Amir, a genetic counselor who highlighted the importance of having our device and biological mechanism accredited by CAP CLIA if the results were to be considered by doctors and healthcare professionals. Moreover, she advised us to calculate the accuracy of our device in detecting fluorescence emitted and take that into account when reporting a diagnosis.</span>

                        <span>As for the ethics behind human research and the psychological aspect of genetic testing, we interviewed Dr. Jeniffer Bruder who gave us insight into several aspects of the project. She helped us better understand the best way to introduce the project to people, how to deliver the results in an objective and safe way, and emphasized that human interaction is very necessary for every step of the test as an individual should feel that the project is not only about the science behind it, but also about his own health and benefit.</span>

We decided to make a pre-counseling liability % calculation using a database based on parameters requested by an application.</p>
                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">To complement this process, Dr. Bruder highlighted the downside of a machine-based report, thus we restrict the usage of the device to individuals with health care experience. We also took Dr. Afifi’s feedback about paying attention to the quality of the DNA that is extracted from saliva.</p>
