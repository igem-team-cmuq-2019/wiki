                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">CRISPR is becoming an indispensable tool in biological research. Once known as the bacterial immune system against invading viruses, 
                        the programmable capacity of the Cas9 enzyme is now revolutionizing diverse fields of medical research, biotechnology, 
                        and agriculture. CRISPR-Cas9 is no longer just a gene-editing tool; the application areas of catalytically impaired inactive Cas9, 
                        including gene regulation, epigenetic editing, chromatin engineering, and imaging, now exceed the gene-editing functionality of 
                        WT Cas9 <sup><a href = "#ref1"> [1]</a></sup>. Some potential application of this system could also be used in the treatment 
                        of different diseases, such as pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematologic, immune system, viral, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and cancer<sup><a href = "#ref6"> [6]</a></sup>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Sickle Cell Anemia is one of the most common, severe, monogenic disorders in the world. Genetic studies indicate that this condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern where parents, often showing no symptoms of the condition, each contributes one copy of the mutated gene. This genetic disease is mainly caused by rs334, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the Hemoglobin- coding gene (HBB). Prevalence of sickle cell trait varies greatly between different regions but reaches levels as high as 40 percent in some areas of sub-Saharan Africa, eastern Saudi Arabia, and central India.</p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Current treatment might include antibiotics, vitamins, Blood transfusions, pain-relieving medicines, other medications and possibly surgery, suchas to correct vision problems or to remove a damaged spleen.</p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR which is responsible for
                            coding for chloride channel into and out of cells. Chloride ion is important in cells as it
                            regulates the movement of water in tissues (osmolarity), which is necessary for the
                            production of thin, freely flowing mucus. The phenotype observed are difficulty
                            breathing and coughing up mucus as a result of frequent lung infections. Other signs
                            and symptoms may include sinus infections, poor growth, fatty stool, clubbing of the
                            fingers and toes, and infertility in most males. There is no known statistics for the
                            detection rate in Qatar.</p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Currently, there is no known cure for cystic fibrosis. Lung infections are treated
                            with antibiotics which may be given intravenously, inhaled, or by mouth. Sometimes,
                            the antibiotic azithromycin is used long term. Lung transplantation may be an option
                            if lung function continues to worsen. Pancreatic enzyme replacement and fat-soluble
                            vitamin supplementation is important, especially in the young.

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Although there are the traditional laboratory methods which withdraw blood to test for genetic diseases, 
                        today a variety of alternative techniques are being introduced, presenting a high competition in this field. 
                        According to the American Association of Cereal Chemist (AACC) carrier testing, today can be done by extracting genome from a 
                        body part or fluid that will then undergo PCR, DNA Sequencing, Cytogenetic Analysis, Microarrays, or Gene Expression Profiling, 
                        depending on the type of mutation searched for. The mentioned methods are observed to be time-consuming, require a lot of expertise 
                        and lab equipment. Studying sickle cell anemia as one of our prototype diseases, we came across a recent method for detecting 
                        carriers based on intrinsic characteristics and physical differences of the red blood cells as explained in this article. 
                        While such a technique could be efficient and low in cost, it remains invasive and presents biohazards. Moreover, this technique is limited to sickle cell anemia, 
                        where another non blood related genetic disease can not be detected. 
                          <sup><a href = "#ref5"> [5]</a></sup>
                    </p>
                    <p class = "blockContent text-ubuntu">As for testing for Cystic Fibrosis, the most non-invasive current method is 
                        sweat test where people who have Cystic Fibrosis tend to have a much higher chloride concentration. 
                        However, to test for carriers, DNA is extracted from blood or cheek swabs and then traditional sequencing 
                        is done<sup><a href = "#ref6"> [6]</a></sup>.

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Our preliminary kit aims to provide a first step of genetic testing where if suspicious results are obtained, further and more detailed testing can be done. The biological mechanism behind this genetic test depends on the ability of the Cas12a protein to detect a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of a gene. That is done by having a designed guide RNA (gRNA) with a fixed loop in the reaction solution where the fixed loop will help the gRNA to integrate itself within Cas12a in order to guide it to find the SNP of interest. As Cas12a utilizes gRNA and a TTTN Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) on the DNA template to detect the SNP, upon detection, binding of the Cas12a and DNA-template occurs to form a reaction complex. This complex initiates an indiscriminate cleavage activity where single and double stranded nucleic acids get cut. Taking advantage of this characteristic, we use a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) reporter molecule which has a quencher and a fluorescent tag. When the indiscriminate cleavage activity is initiated, this ssDNA reporter molecule gets cleaved allowing the fluorescent tag to emit fluorescence as it is no longer quenched. </p>
                    <p class = "blockContent text-ubuntu">We endeavored to extract DNA from saliva to eliminate the biohazardous use of blood. In addition,our project design  paid particular attention to the importance of genetic counseling. Genetic tests have been heavily stigmatized that people tend to either hesitate to take them or remain tense about the results, which we understand. Thus, we worked on developing an application that includes the necessary algorithm for %liability calculation to prepare the patient with possible expected results. The integrated algorithm will help in saving the time and the money usually invested in finding the risk percentage of a specific disease within the normal pre-test counseling and it will psychologically prepare the patient for any type of results. Whilst the pre-counselling results will be prepared by a machine, we recommend that the device and software are to be used with people with healthcare experience in order to better deliver results.Furthermore, although we are using statistical knowledge to draw possible outcomes from the calculated liability percentage as a first step, we still recommend that the report produced by our application/software would be reviewed by a genetic counselor for deeper analysis.</p>
