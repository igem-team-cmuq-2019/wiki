                        <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">We were mentored by <strong>iGEM Team Tubingen</strong> through how to model experimentally determined fluorescence values. They advised us to use machine learning by integrating a database of labeled DNA, as well as to consider DNA lengths for consistency and meaningful extrapolation of fluorescent value, which inspired us to develop software of a mobile application to aid us in diagnostic purposes.</p>

                        <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">We assisted <strong>iGEM Team Lund</strong> by integrating an ethical synthetic biology question into a campus-wide discussion and then reported the results back to them to gain insight on the perspectives of a diverse community. The results were documented and shared with the group after the debate took place on the CMUQ campus. We also collaborated with Team Dresden to find a solution to wiki-related troubleshooting which they polished into a video and attended Team Marburg’s Golden Gate cloning Webinar.</p>

                        <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu"><strong>Team Marburg</strong> was very helpful in providing a common platform for many iGEM teams to come together, learn, and discuss the synthetic biology technique “Golden Gate Assembly”. We met in a webinar where a live presentation with a shred screen was given as well as protocols to refer to. While we did not utilize the technique this year, however, we believe in its efficiency and will consider it for the next project.  </p>

                        <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Responding to <strong>Team TU Dresden’</strong> collaboration post on creating a video on “How to iGEM”. We wanted to take part in sharing concerns, providing helpful insight in aim to help other teams and to facilitate the journey of the future iGEMers. We were particularly interested in the “How to Wiki” part of the collaboration as our software team was facing some challenges in manipulating the wiki to upload the needed files and navigate through it. However, taking part in this collaboration allowed us to teach other teams what we know while also learning from other team’s knowledge. Now our software teams managed to design a CSS framework from scratch that aligns with iGEM's default styling.</p>
