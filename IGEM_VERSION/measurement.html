SDS-PAGE gels were used to prepare western blots which were utilized to validate the identity of purified protein and quantify it using anti-HA antibodies. The bioanalyzer was used to observe DNA fragmentation using cas12a enzymes in very small amounts of DNA. For assays that don’t require small amounts of DNA such as restriction digest and PCR products, ethidium bromide agarose gels were prepared, and lambda DNA was used to estimate the amount of DNA. A fluorescence microplate reader was used to test emission from samples containing our gRNA, sample DNA and Cas12a protein of varying concentrations to determine optimum concentrations and background fluorescence from the samples. This reading was done as a preliminary result that informed the volumes and concentration used in the device.</p>
