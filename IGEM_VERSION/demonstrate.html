We aimed to demonstrate the validity of the idea with more lab work and due to the need of many Cas12a proteins for testing we expressed more of it. To do so,  BL21 cells were inoculated and grown to mid-log phase(OD 30-40 Klettts), then the culture was induced by IPTG for 18 hours and the proteins were harvested by being centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 minutes. The western-blot showed that Cas12 protein was produced and successfully purified using HA column. The functionality of the Cas12a protein was demonstrated by measuring the emitted fluorescence correlated with fragmentation using a bioanalyzer. Detection of the fragmentation indicates Cas12a identification of the SNP by successfully using the designed, SNP-specific gRNA. As to measuring the fluorescence using our device, its ability to accurately measure fluorescence was verified using DNAse Alert Kit </p>
