                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">With the recent developments of the Cas12a enzyme, our biology team was able to use its matching and breaking abilities to snap matching gene sequences to that of a specific genetic disease, such as: sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, etc. With the aid of an identifier molecule that has a fluorescent tag, we can map these identifiers throughout the genetic sequence, such that when the Cas12a enzyme snaps on matching gene sequences, the identifier’s fluorescent tag gets released. To be able to detect the level of fluorescent tags released, we have to excite the tags with 535 nm of light, and at full emission should emit back at 555 nm.</p>
                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Keeping the quantities of identifiers controlled, we can analyze multiple test trials to probabilistically plot a threshold value for which we can deterministically say whether a patient’s genes carry a certain genetic disease. </p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">In tight tandem with the bio-lab team, the hardware team was able to design and develop a complete hardware interface. After coming with a list of requirements that the device should satisfy, we went through several iterations of components, circuit designs, and overall schematics before coming to a design we were all happy with.</p>

                            <span>This design was built around the purpose of a tight and small product that fit all the modules as close as possible. It was to be 15cm by 2cm, roughly the size of a marker, with a hole on one end to insert the testing cuvette. Given the size restraints, battery life and actual user functionality was limited with how small it was.</span>

                        <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">This next design was inspired to be more ergonomic in shape and size, as well improve the cuvette encapsulation module. Given our specs it would have had a 100% increase in battery life, and much easier user handling. The design featured a skeleton that housed the cuvette module and electronics container, surrounded by two outer sheaths. One of the sheaths was movable and would snap open and close with neodymium magnets to reveal the cuvette module. This design was limited by its sophisticated construction, and because the team, in tandem with the biology team, decided to move from cuvettes to micro tubes for closer fluorescence analysis.</p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">This final design complemented the best features of previous designs while also shaping it around the specificity of the micro tube. The design features a similar shape to the last without any sheathing outer walls, only a partly rotating cover to open and close the micro tube encapsulation module. Otherwise it is very similar in structure to the last with an electronics container and wire channels.</p>

Although the HC-05 communicates at 3.3V, we had to integrate a voltage divider to protect the HC05 from surges and ensure a stable line of communication. Otherwise the Pro Mini provides a great low profile and a variety of analog and digital pins, with I2C and Serial communication for our LCD and Bluetooth modules.</td>
