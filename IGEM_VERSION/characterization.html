                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">We investigated the effect of glucose on the levels of expression of araC controlled GFP by measuring fluorescence levels. The strain of E. coli used was E. coli BL21 (DE3). The bacteria were transformed with pLysSBL-21 (DE3) from Promega (catalog number L1198 ) plasmid, to which we integrated the inducible araC-pBad promoter with GFPmut3b, a strong ribosome binding site (Bba_K731250).</p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">The concentration of bacteria remained relatively constant across the different concentrations of arabinose. Hence, arabinose does not affect the growth rate of cells and changes in levels of GFP shown in Figure 5 may be attributable to promoter activity. However, we note that LB+chl+IPTG had a slower growth compared to the other permutation of the media.</p>

                    <p class="blockContent text-ubuntu">Expression levels of GFP in various different conditions of E. coli environment was measured. We observe that an increase in arabinose levels leads to an increase in the levels of GFP expressed. We also observe that the presence of glucose in the media significantly reduces the levels of GFP expressed. Thus we conclude that araC promoter activity is positively regulated by arabinose but negatively regulated by glucose.</p>
